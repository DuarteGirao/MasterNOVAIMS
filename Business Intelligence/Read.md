## Presentation of the Business Organization <br>
Brikint is a retail company specializing in selling a wide variety of products and services from a wide 
range of brands, mainly in the technology and electronic sectors. Established as a start-up in the USA 
in 1980, two young and wealthy business analysts came together to raise the business with their 
capital. During the initial five years, they were able to develop the company, with a focus on serving 
local communities, by signing supply agreements, establishing partnerships, and gaining customer 
loyalty. However, the first few years were difficult, and the company struggled to make a name for 
itself in the market.
With a decade of hard work and dedication, the business began to reap the rewards, and by the end 
of the twentieth century, the company then decided to expand internationally, along with a digital 
transformation of all the business processes, with Canada being the first choice.
As of the end of 2021, Brikint has become a big-sized company, leading in the market in the retail 
sector, shaping the current market and among the top preferences of customers. The business 
summary is the following:
• Sales are made in 5 continents and 7 countries: Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, 
Mexico, Nigeria, and USA;
• Sales are made via 30 shops: Australia(6), Canada(4), Germany(3), Japan(2),
