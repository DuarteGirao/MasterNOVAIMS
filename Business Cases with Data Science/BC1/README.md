# MastersNovaIMS-BCWDS-BC1-Customer_Segmentation

## ðŸ“– Introduction
    
Within the scope of __Business Cases for Data Science__, it was proposed a project, where the groups' ability to deliver a customer segmentation in accordance with the different features included in a dataset containing 111.733 records would be tested. However, A, the new marketing manager of the hotel H, realized that the current customer segmentation was not useful for the hotel marketing department, as it only reflected one only customer characteristic, its sales origin.
    
Therefore, the business goal determined for this project was to develop a new customer segmentation and gaining insight on the current customers' characteristics. By understanding the differences between the different segments, organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing.
