# Customer-churn-prediction


## ðŸ“– Introduction

In the hotel industry, as in many other travel-related industries, demand is managed through advanced bookings. Bookings (also
known as reservations) are a forward contract between the hotel and the customer that gives the customer the right to use the
service in the future at a settled price, but often with an option to cancel.
The cancellation option puts the risk on hotels who have to honor the bookings that they have on-the-books, but, at the same time, have to support the opportunity costs of having vacant rooms when someone cancels, and there is no time to try to sell the room or sell it at a discounted price. In Europe, the cancellation rate by reservation value, from 2014 to 2018, rose from 33% 
to 40%. <br>

Concerned about the increasingly negative impact caused by cancellations, A, the Revenue Manager Director of hotel chain C, a
chain with resort and city hotels in Portugal, hired a consultant to evaluate the possibility of developing predictive models to predict net demand for their hotels. The hotel provided the consultant datasets of one resort hotel (H1) and of one city hotel (H2), of bookings that were due to arrive between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017.
The name of the individual and the company name is anonymized to protect confidentiality. The referenced data are real.
Net demand is defined as demand minus cancellations.

## ðŸ“– Key Problems
    
Within the scope of __Business Cases for Data Science__, C hotel chain operation is not different from other independent and non-independent hotel chains. C hotel chain operation was severally impacted by cancellations, with cancellations, as presented in Table 1, representing almost 28% in H1 and almost 42% in H2. For this reason, A, decided to limit the number of rooms sold with restrictive cancellation policies. To balance that decision, A implemented a more aggressive overbooking policy. However, the latter started to generate costs. To counterbalance those costs, A, soften the overbooking policy, which in turn
was also revealed to be not good. The less aggressive overbooking policy resulted in the hotel having inventory not sold, even on high-demand dates.
    
To reduce the uncertainty about demand, A wanted to implement prediction models to allow the chainâ€™s hotels to forecast net demand based on reservations on-the-books. With these modelsâ€™ estimations, A expected to implement better pricing and
overbooking policies but also do identify bookings with a high likelihood of canceling. Identifying those bookings could allow the hotels to try to contact those bookingsâ€™ customers and make offers to try to prevent cancellation (e.g., dinner, car parking, spa treatments, discounts, or other perks). The goal of A was to reduce cancellations to a rate of 20%.
