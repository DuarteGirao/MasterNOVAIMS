## ðŸ“– Introduction
    
Within the scope of __Business Cases for Data Science__, it was proposed a project, where the groups' ability to deliver a market basket analysis in accordance with the different features included in a dataset containing 84.109 records would be tested. However, the company C that ownes this restaurant realized that they are not having enough profits and therefore, wishes to better understand their customers and its preferences.
    
Therefore, the business goal determined for this project was to develop a market basket analysis. C expects to gain insights in terms of creation of menus, introduction of new products, understand substitute products, recommending/promoting cross-selling, customer segmentation and other possible results depending on the findings. 

C has several questions that it hopes to get answers to:
- Are there any differences between dine-inn customers and delivery customers?
- Is the product offering adequate (e.g., do customers make strange combination of products) ?
- Are there any patterns in consumption that may indicate tendencies?
